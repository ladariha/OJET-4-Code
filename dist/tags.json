If the min and/or max attribute is set, an implicit DateTimeRangeValidator may be created. At runtime when the component runs validation, it combines all the implicit validators with all the validators specified through this validators attribute, and runs all of them. Hints exposed by validators are shown in the notewindow by default, or as determined by the 'validatorHint' property set on the displayOptions property. When validators property changes due to programmatic intervention, the element may decide to clear messages and run validation, based on the current state it is in. Steps Performed Always The cached list of validator instances are cleared and new validator hints is pushed to messaging. E.g., notewindow displays the new hint(s). Running Validation if element is valid when validators changes, element does nothing other than the steps it always performs. if element is invalid and is showing messages when validators changes then all element messages are cleared and full validation run using the display value on the element. if there are validation errors, then value property is not updated and the error is shown. if no errors result from the validation, the value property is updated; page author can listen to the valueChanged event to clear custom errors. if element is invalid and has deferred messages when validators changes, it does nothing other than the steps it performs always. Clearing Messages Only messages created by the element are cleared. messagesCustom property is not cleared.
